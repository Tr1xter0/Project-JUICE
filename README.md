# Project-JUICE
Changes: 2023-05-10
* Font size for the info text.
* Size and position for the lines seperating the first section from the other.
* Removed hover effect from icon in the top right corner.
* Added a line under header (might not keep it)
* Played around more with the color options, probably sticking with the current one.
* Copy pasted the header and footer for the main site to the others to see if they work as they should.
* Pressing the glass icon will now lead to cornhub. CORNHUB, not P-Hub (will ofcourse be changed later on)
* You can also change between all the tabs now. (other sites are still under construction so they look shit af dude?!?!?!?)
